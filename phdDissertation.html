            <h2>Writing a Ph.D. Dissertation can seem overwhelming</h2>
            <p>Dissertation or Thesis are used interchangeably today; the American Institutions at large prefer the word ‘dissertation’ while European Institutions are accustomed to the word “thesis.” In North America, the word “dissertation” is primarily used for Ph.D. work of a student while the thesis is preferred for Master’s degree. The thesis or dissertation normally refers to the culmination of a student’ research as a final requirement for the degree sought (Fitt et al. 2009). Although thesis refers to Master’s dissertation, since in general researchers call Ph.D. as thesis, we use the word thesis for Ph.D. dissertation.</p>
            <p>A Doctorate in Philosophy (Ph.D. or DPhil) is one of the highest academic degrees. Ph.D. appear to represent unique configurations. and doing a Ph.D. is oriented around research, believed in creating new knowledge by conducting independent research in his or her chosen area. Advance a provocative thesis that speaks to large controversies by refuting and refining an argument, reveal a gap, fill a gap, ask a new question or refine an older question. To conduct research in an area, Ph.D. researchers require deep knowledge in that area, and related areas, and the working experience on research problem (problems whose outcome are not known). In other words, to gain the awards, a student is typically required to make a substantial original contribution to knowledge, evidenced through a thesis that is examined by academic peers. Hence to develop such compatibility among researchers, usually Ph.D. programs have three components in them.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Coursework to provide the breadth of knowledge</li>
                <li>Some methods to develop the depth of knowledge.</li>
                <li>Thesis that provide the experience of working on research problems.</li>
            </ul>
